Architecture
Short answer:

Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:

    Depending on how many cores the computer has determines whether the CPU can use concurrency or parallelism. Parallelism is available with multiple processors since then multiple programs can execute simultaneously. When the CPU only has one processing unit, true parallel computing is not possible, but concurrency mimics parallelism closely. Two programs may run on one CPU, but they won't be executing at the exact same time since they share the CPU's processor system.  

Describe assembly language and machine language:

    Machine language is the lowest level language programs are translated to that the computer understands. It consists of 0s and 1s. Assembly language is a human readable translation of machine language. For instance, register addresses are stored in variable names since a variable is easier to read and remember than its complementary machine code.

Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?

    Graphics cards have their own dedicated RAM and other processors that allow computers to take advantage of parallel computing and faster processing. 3D rendering puts a huge load onto computer processing, so GPUs take most of that load off of the CPU.

Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:

    Graphics cards are much faster at processing than CPUs. Machine learning programs use a lot of computing power and the programs being built now and future ones will grow in complexity. Graphics cards cut the time needed to process dramatically and allows these applications to become more intelligent with more efficient run times.
